# Global Crop Distribution, Deforestation, and Biodiversity Hotspots
Be, Ritu, Caitlin, Rajamani

## Project Focus
Visualize the overlap between global agricultural crop distribution, deforestation rates, and biodiversity hotspots to understand the impact of agricultural expansion on biodiversity and forest loss.<br>

- **Identify High-Risk Areas:** Pinpoint regions where agricultural expansion is driving both deforestation and biodiversity loss, providing actionable insights for conservation efforts.<br>
- **Understand Crop-Specific Impacts:** Analyze how specific crops are linked to deforestation and biodiversity loss, which can help guide sustainable agricultural practices and policies.<br>
- **Temporal Changes:** Understand how the dynamics of deforestation and biodiversity loss have changed over time and how current trends might continue if no action is taken.
